                        Johnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic, swashbuckling anti-hero Jack Sparrow in the all-new ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.‚Äù The rip-roaring adventure finds down-on-his-luck Captain Jack feeling the winds of ill-fortune blowing strongly his way when deadly ghost sailors, led by the terrifying Captain Salazar (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil's Triangle bent on killing every pirate at sea‚Äînotably Jack. Jack's only hope of survival lies in the legendary Trident of Poseidon, but to find it he must forge an uneasy alliance with Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a brilliant and beautiful astronomer, and Henry (Brenton Thwaites), a headstrong young sailor in the Royal Navy. At the helm of the Dying Gull, his pitifully small and shabby ship, Captain Jack seeks not only to reverse his recent spate of ill fortune, but to save his very life from the most formidable and malicious foe he has ever faced. <br />

Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast‚Äù is a live-action re-telling of the studio‚Äôs animated classic which refashions the classic characters from the tale as old as time for a contemporary audience, staying true to the original music while updating the score with several new songs. ‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast‚Äù is the fantastic journey of Belle, a bright, beautiful and independent young woman who is taken prisoner by a beast in his castle. Despite her fears, she befriends the castle‚Äôs enchanted staff and learns to look beyond the Beast‚Äôs hideous exterior and realize the kind heart and soul of the true Prince within. The film stars: Emma Watson as Belle; Dan Stevens as the Beast; Luke Evans as Gaston, the handsome, but shallow villager who woos Belle; Oscar¬Æ winner Kevin Kline as Maurice, Belle‚Äôs eccentric, but lovable father; Josh Gad as Lefou, Gaston‚Äôs long-suffering aide-de-camp; Golden Globe¬Æ nominee Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, the candelabra; Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci as Maestro Cadenza, the harpsichord; Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Plumette, the feather duster; six-time Tony Award¬Æ winner Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe, the wardrobe; Oscar nominee Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, the mantel clock; and two-time Academy Award¬Æ winner Emma Thompson as the teapot, Mrs. Potts.

Directed by Oscar¬Æ winner Bill Condon from a screenplay by TBD based on the 1991 animated film, the film is produced by Mandeville Films‚Äô David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman with eight-time Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken, who won two Academy Awards¬Æ (Best Original Score and Best Song) for the 1991 animated film, providing the score, which will include new recordings of the original songs written by Menken and Howard Ashman, as well as several new songs written by Menken and three-time Oscar winner Tim Rice. ‚ÄúBeauty and the Beast‚Äù will be released in U.S. theaters on March 17, 2017.'>

A reimagining of Disney‚Äôs cherished family film, ‚ÄúPete‚Äôs Dragon‚Äù is the adventure of an orphaned boy named Pete and his best friend Elliott, who just so happens to be a dragon. ‚ÄúPete‚Äôs Dragon‚Äù stars Bryce Dallas Howard, Oakes Fegley, Wes Bentley, Karl Urban, Oona Laurence and Oscar¬Æ winner Robert Redford. The film, which is directed by David Lower, is written by Lowery & Toby Halbrooks based on a story by Seton I. Miller and S.S. Field and produced by Jim Whitaker, p.g.a., with Barrie M. Osborne serving as executive producer.

For years, old wood carver Mr. Meacham (Robert Redford) has delighted local children with his tales of the fierce dragon that resides deep in the woods of the Pacific Northwest. To his daughter, Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), who works as a forest ranger, these stories are little more than tall tales‚Ä¶until she meets Pete (Oakes Fegley). Pete is a mysterious 10-year-old with no family and no home who claims to live in the woods with a giant, green dragon named Elliott. And from Pete‚Äôs descriptions, Elliott seems remarkably similar to the dragon from Mr. Meacham‚Äôs stories. With the help of Natalie (Oona Laurence), an 11-year-old girl whose father Jack (Wes Bentley) owns the local lumber mill, Grace sets out to determine where Pete came from, where he belongs, and the truth about this dragon. Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúPete‚Äôs Dragon‚Äù opens in U.S. theaters on August 12, 2016.

                        <a href='http://www.bluerayvids.com/watch/y1fZg0hhBX8' title='Disney's The BFG comes to theaters July 1, 2016!

                           The talents of three of the world‚Äôs greatest storytellers ‚Äì Roald Dahl, Walt Disney and Steven Spielberg ‚Äìfinally unite to bring Dahl‚Äôs beloved classic ‚ÄúThe BFG‚Äù to life. Directed by Spielberg, Disney‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe BFG‚Äù tells the imaginative story of a young girl and the Giant who introduces her to the wonders and perils of Giant Country. The BFG (Mark Rylance), while a giant himself, is a Big Friendly Giant and nothing like the other inhabitants of Giant Country. Standing 24-feet tall with enormous ears and a keen sense of smell, he is endearingly dim-witted and keeps to himself for the most part. Giants like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Fleshlumpeater (Jemaine Clement) on the other hand, are twice as big and at least twice as scary and have been known to eat humans, while the BFG prefers Snozzcumber and Frobscottle. Upon her arrival in Giant Country, Sophie, a precocious 10-year-old girl from London, is initially frightened of the mysterious giant who has brought her to his cave, but soon comes to realize that the BFG is actually quite gentle and charming, and, having never met a giant before, has many questions. The BFG brings Sophie to Dream Country where he collects dreams and sends them to children, teaching her all about the magic and mystery of dreams. Having both been on their own in the world up until now, their affection for one another quickly grows, but Sophie‚Äôs presence in Giant Country has attracted the unwanted attention of the other giants, who have become increasingly more bothersome. Sophie and the BFG soon depart for London to see the Queen (Penelope Wilton) and warn her of the precarious giant situation, but they must first convince the Queen and her maid, Mary (Rebecca Hall), that giants do indeed exist. Together, they come up with a plan to get rid of the giants once and for all.
